 * The commissioner's notes to the league, keyed by the week whose page shows

 * renders whichever note matches the week being viewed, and a week with no
 * note simply shows none rather than an old one shouting about a week gone by.
 *
 * Every fact in a note is checked against the real schedule and the real
 * results before it is published: a made-up stat in a note to the whole family
 * would be found out by Sunday lunch. The callout's deadline is asserted
 * against the schedule by notes.test.ts.
 *
 * Other people's picks for a week stay hidden until that week locks, so a note
 * published before the lock never names anyone's pick for that week.

    'The picks are in, and the crow that lives at the top of this page has started taking notes. He doesn’t say much. He doesn’t need to. He just looked at the Steelers line and tilted his head.',
    'Let’s start with the Harkovs. Michele, Steve, Jordan and Eli: four Harkovs, one team, one 8:30 Sunday morning kickoff in New Orleans. A third of this league is riding on a breakfast game. Aaron looked at the family plan, said “no thank you,” and took the Jets. Aaron, either you know something or the group chat is about to get very quiet.',
    'Now, Eden. Eden is a Bears fan. Everybody knows Eden is a Bears fan. And yet, with a life on the line, Eden picked the 49ers, the home team of Aunt Michele, Uncle Steve, and cousins Jordan, Aaron and Eli. A lovely gesture, except not one of those five picked the 49ers themselves. Eden is backing the Harkovs’ team harder than the Harkovs are. Somebody in that house owes Eden dinner.',
    'Then there’s Orit, who married my brother Eyal. Eyal bleeds navy and orange. Orit picked the Patriots. To beat the Bears. Tonight. In Chicago. In the first game of the week, so the whole house finds out before dessert. And Eyal, the die-hard? He took the Panthers. So nobody in that marriage trusted Chicago this week, but only one of them will be openly cheering against it from the couch. The crow respects it. He has also asked whether Orit has somewhere else to sleep tonight.',
    'Everyone else: Karin on the Vikings, Robin on the Browns, Tzvi on the Broncos, and your commissioner on the Texans. Twelve players, nine teams, and not a single one of you picked the Bears, including both Bears fans. Chicago, I’m sorry. Even your own people are on the run.',
